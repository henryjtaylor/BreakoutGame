Only I, Henry Taylor, worked on this project. I started Monday the 16th and worked about 15 hours on it. The only resources I used was the Java documentation. The class that runs the program is Main.java. The only other resources needed are the images in the images folder. 
The only bug I found is sometimes the ball gets stuck on the platform, but I think that has to do with the pixel size rather than the programming. I felt like I did well, but I need to spend more time planning how I will organize all my classes.
